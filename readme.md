#Week 4 : Paint

##Presentation :
We had to recreate a really basic __Paint__ using Jquery.

##What's inside :
__index.html__ : I used a canvas to draw and added some tools represented by buttons,  
an input range and an input color. Also used some bootstrap classes for display of buttons.  
__main.css__ : Only a few flex declarations to position everything.  
__main.js__ : I used mostly events (click, mousedown, mousemove, mouseout, mouseup) to draw.  
Rectangles and circles can be drawn by 'drag-an-drop' (circle calculates the radius with hypothenuse).

##How ?
Mostly JQuery + DOM
